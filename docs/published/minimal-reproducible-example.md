> a.k.a. how to get faster help

Often I see people asking questions in this Discord posting their code in various ways that make debugging challenging. Ranking from worst to best:

- Posting a link to the whole repo.
  Problem: It's overwhelming and requires too much effort to locate the issue.
- Sharing whole file(s).
  Same problem: need to comb through unnecessary details.
- Copy-pasting large fragments of unsimplified code directly from the codebase.
  Problem: It's still hard to find the core issue.
- Sharing a simplified problem.
  Better, but might still include some irrelevant parts.
- Providing a minimum reproducible example or a simple toy example constructed from the actual problem
  Ideal, as it isolates the problem and makes it easy for others to help.

## What is an MRE?

As the name suggests, it should be

- minimal: as small as possible. Doesn't contain any extra code not contributing to the problem.
- reproducible: should contain complete information to reproduce the problem if someone put it on their on computer or a repl

Below I will show some real problems asked in this Discord and how they could've been minimized.

Problem 1: [How sincronize correctly state with snippets and classes](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/1329285855508172810)
(Don't click the source if you want to try solving this yourself)
[Original REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/28eb9868e4a74ebea2e5674492d1fdad?version=5.18.0)

Description:

> when the `times` property of each todo reaches to 0 then the todo itslef must crossed-out.

A fairly simple one. The bug isn't Svelte-related. To replicate the problem, first you must add a random todo title and a random `times` number. Then, press the button on the newly created todo until `times` reaches 0. The todo isn't crossed out unless you press the button once more.

First, this is a js problem so I'm gonna remove almost all the css but the `.line-through`:

```html
<style>
	.line-through {
		text-decoration: line-through;
	}
</style>
```

Second, I'm deleting the 'create todo' section since it's irrelevant to the problem. The variables `todoText`, `todoTimes` and the function `validateAddTodo` now serve no purpose and can be removed too. Temporarily delete the `$inspect`, may add it back later if necessary. Now we don't have any todo to show. Add one by calling `todos.addTodo` in the `script` block:

```js
todos.addTodo('foo', 1)
```

This is where we are now: [REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/888459f5d6d54de5bc02ae3b7a79f568?version=5.18.0)
Can it be simplified more? Yes. Since we're rendering only 1 todo, I'm deleting the `main` section with the `#each` block. I'm also moving the `span` and the `button` out of the `snippet`, with some modifications, to show the todo directly.

```html
<span>{todos.allTodos[0].times}</span> <button onclick="{()" ="">todos.finishTodo(0, todos.allTodos[0].times)} class={todos.allTodos[0].ready ? 'line-through ' : ''} > {todos.allTodos[0].todo}</button>
```

The problem can still be reproduced. However, all the `todos.allTodos[0]` stuff isn't great. We can simplify all that by declaring a single `todo` and use that directly instead:

```js
let todo = $state({ title: 'foo', times: 1, ready: false })
//changing the `todo` property name to `title` to avoid `todo.todo`
```

The `onclick` handler should be changed too. Copy the `todos.finishTodo` function out from the class to use directly, with some modifications to make it work with our single todo:

```js
const finishTodo = () => {
	if (todo.ready) return //  prevents unnecesary executions
	if (todo.times === 0) {
		todo.ready = true
	} else {
		todo.times--
	}
}
```

Problem 2: [$state() in place of writable](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/1328988490318483499)
(You can go there for more context, there's no spoiler)
No REPL was provided so I'm creating one: [Original REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/453ff80c78204f7b8ac23810c4b7cae0?version=5.19.0).
This is an example of an incomplete or unreproducible problem. The OP only stated vaguely 'ui is not changing accordingly'. He was asked to clarify then provided more info:

> i am changing currStep and on handlBack it should reflect currStep is decrement by 1
>
> Still unclear where and how he's changing it. Then he posted a long snippet of code showing the whole component, which I copied to the `Stepper.svelte` file in the REPL. There's still confusion on how the component is used. He was asked to simplify more or put everything in a reproducible REPL, but then didn't do it and marked the question as solved instead, not getting any answers.

Here I have to make some guess work to identify the problem and make it reproducible. Looking at the `not-sure-what-this-is.js` file (naming is hard, especially with incomplete information ü•≤), I see that the imported `Stepper` component is put into an object with some more info and a `render` method. The object is exported as default. There's another exported `Default` variable containing all the props for the `Stepper` component with values imported from `stepper.svelte.js`. I guess the `Default` variable is intended to be the default argument for the `render` method which will somehow programmatically render the component. This seems to be intended for the [`render`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/imperative-component-api#render) API. However, this will involve a server and I cannot guess further how the OP wants to use it. For the sake of this demonstration, I'm taking a leap and add something to recreate the problem in a slightly different way which still preserves the spirit of the original problem. In `App.svelte` I add:

```html
<script>
	import store, { Default } from './not-sure-what-this-is.js'
</script>

<store.component {...Default.args} />
```

here I render the `store.component`, which is just the `Stepper` component in disguised, with the props spread from `Default.args`. Now it shows the `Create Account` label on the output: [REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/45dd4436aa464ffa8bd648a41bccc0ed?version=5.19.0)

Now we can start the simplification process. The OP mentioned that he wanted `currStep` to update on calling `handleBack`, so everything can be removed and replaced with a `back` button. Currently the 'button' is actually a `span` with an `onclick` handle and 3 `svelte-ignore a11y` tags. Urgh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This is what the component looks like after being simplified:

```html
<script lang="ts">
	interface IStepperProps {
		currStep: number
		handleBack: () => void
	}
	let { currStep, handleBack }: IStepperProps = $props()
</script>
<p>{currStep}</p>
<button onclick="{handleBack}">Back</button>
```

Clicking the button does show the alert but doesn't update the `currStep` prop. Problem replicated successfully.
I'm removing the alert and changing the `handleBack` function a bit to be able to call it and potentially update the UI repeatedly:

```js
export const handleBack = () => currStep.value--
```

After some more simplifications, this is where we are now: [REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/8d0765bd58d84f02b0d80c728a5ef1eb?version=5.19.0)

Pretty simplified, I would say. However, I'm gonna take one more step and combine all the `stepper.svelte.js` and `not-sure-what-this-is.js` files into `App.svelte`:

```html
<script>
	import Stepper from './Stepper.svelte'
	const currStep = $state({ value: 1 })
	const props = {
		currStep: currStep.value,
		handleBack: () => currStep.value--,
	}
</script>

<Stepper {...props} />
```

I guess now it should be clear what the core problem is: an excercise for the readers!
[Solution](https://svelte.dev/playground/d5638139b5f246399601be2aeeb61ba1?version=5.19.0)

Problem 3: Dealing with 3rd-party libs.
[How to efficiently handle data fetching and state updates in Svelte 5 forms using the stale-while-revalidate approach too](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/discussions/15026)

Description (after discussion on Discord):

> using `let form = $state(formPlayer)`, the `form` state won't get later updates from the parent component if server response is delayed.

[Original REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/60b15b3698634532b30c9dc61bb031a9?version=5.18.0)

This problem is fairly complex. It uses two 3rd-party libraries: `@tanstack/svelte-query` and `graphql`. Again it is incomplete. Details from `$lib/graphql` and `../players` are missing, so it isn't reproducible out of the box. However, you will see they can be replaced by some basic functions.

I'm gonna simplify the `Form.svelte` component first. I see there's an input to edit `form.player.defaultCoachId` and I will use it as the representative of the form. I also will add a `submit` button. I'm not gonna deal with all the `Tax` and the `cards` related stuff and delete all of them. The `PlayerForm` type isn't provided, but I will replace that. Now the form is fairly minimal with no 3rd-party dependencies:

```html
<script lang="ts" module>
	//exporting for reuse in parent
	export type PlayerForm = {
		player: {
			defaultCoachId: string
		}
	}
	type Submit = (form: PlayerForm) => void
	type Props = {
		formPlayer: PlayerForm
		submit: Submit
	}
</script>
<script lang="ts">
	let { formPlayer, submit }: Props = $props()

	let form = $state(formPlayer)
</script>

<input bind:value="{form.player.defaultCoachId}" />
<button onclick="{()" ="">submit(form)}>Submit</button>
```

Now let's work on the parent `+page.svelte`. To make the `formPlayer` variable we need 2 information: `defaultCoachId` derived from `settingsResult` and `coachId` derived from `teamsStore`. They're both constructed by the same way: calling the `createQuery` function. Assuming that the solution works for one of them, it will definitely work for the other. So I'm keeping only the `defaultCoachId` related stuff, with some more simplifications:

```js
//replacing createQuery with an in-house getSettings function, implementation details added later
const settingsResult = getSettings()

//making defaultCoachId a direct property of $settingsResult, skipping `data`, `edges.find` and newPlayerFromData stuff

let formPlayer = $derived({
	player: { defaultCoachId: $settingsResult.defaultCoachId },
})
```

We can see that `settingsResult` is a Svelte store, most likely a read-only because to modify the data you have to go through the `createMutation` function. So I'm creating a `3rd-party-lib.svelte` module with 2 functions: `getSettings` and `mutateSettings`:

```html
<script lang="ts" module>
	//using .svelte file and script module as a hack to be able to use typescript
	import { readonly, writable } from 'svelte/store'

	//not exposing the writable
	const settings = writable({
		defaultCoachId: 'foo',
	})
	//replaces createQuery
	export function getSettings() {
		return readonly(settings)
	}
	//replaces createMutation
	export function mutateSettings(defaultCoachId: string) {
		settings.set({ defaultCoachId })
	}
</script>
```

The `submit` function is supposed to be an api call that mutates the settings, so let's replace the original with:

```js
    function submit(form: PlayerForm) {
        mutateSettings(form.player.defaultCoachId);
    }
```

We're here now: [REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/114771a2e83d451ca7f59997d5c0ea33?version=5.18.0).

Now the input and the `submit` function just work fine. It's not clear what's the problem is. To show that, I'm adding something to simulate a late server response in the `getSettings` function. Also adding something to show an error case where the api update call fails:

```js
    //replaces createQuery
    export function getSettings() {
        //simulate a late server response that is different than the in-memory stale value
        setTimeout(()=>{
            settings.set({ defaultCoachId : 'bar' });
        }, 2000)
        //return the in-memory value immediately
        return readonly(settings);
    }
    //replaces createMutation
    export function mutateSettings(defaultCoachId: string) {
        const p = Math.random();
        //simulate an update failure rate of 50% (outrageous!)
        if(p > 0.5){
            settings.set({ defaultCoachId });
        } else {
            console.log('update error!');
        }
    }
```

[Final REPL](https://svelte.dev/playground/ed50485367984006935ab18eb24c174f?version=5.18.0)

It's clear now what the problem is: initially we get the settings and render the form with `defaultCoachId: 'foo'`. 2 seconds later, the server returns a different value: `defaultCoachId: 'bar'` but our form still displays 'foo'. Furthermore, on form submission, the input falsely shows that the value is updated to whatever we typed in, while the server value has a 50% chance of not being updated.

The problem now has no 3rd-party dependencies so it's much more welcoming to all the devs with no knowledge about them. You know the drills: it is now left to the hands of the readers.
