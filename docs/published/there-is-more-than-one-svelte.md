## What does “Svelte” mean?

Svelte isn’t just one thing — it’s many, depending on how you use it and where you look:

- A **language** with its own syntax (`<script>`, `$state`, `bind:`, etc.)
- A **compiler** that transforms that syntax into efficient JavaScript
- A **runtime** that powers reactivity, transitions, and lifecycle hooks
- A **preprocessor** layer for handling TypeScript, SCSS, Markdown, and more
- A **UI framework** that brings all of the above together, distributed as an npm package
- A **design philosophy** rooted in simplicity, minimalism, and zero-runtime overhead
- A **community and ecosystem** with REPLs, plugins, preprocessors, libraries, and tools

Depending on the context, “Svelte” might refer to the authoring experience, the compiled output, the runtime behavior, or the surrounding ecosystem.

Understanding these distinctions helps you make better decisions — and build more idiomatic, maintainable apps.
