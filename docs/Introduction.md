> [!note] The missing documentation for Svelte and SvelteKit.

This isn’t a replacement for the official docs — it’s what the official docs _don’t_ cover.

- Logical groupings of concepts
- Animations and illustrations
- REPL examples
- Real-world usage patterns

The Svelte Language exposes low-level APIs that give developers a lot of flexibility — but that also means it’s easy to get lost or reinvent the wheel. This site aims to fill that gap by showcasing common patterns, best practices, and reusable abstractions built _on top of_ Svelte.

In practice, some APIs — like $effect, bind:, and streaming with promises — tend to introduce complexity or less predictable behavior, even though they’re presented equally in the official docs. Here, we highlight those distinctions and explain _why_ some approaches tend to work better.
